# 4004 Delay Loop Calculator
I found it tedious to calculate the register values used in delay loops for my Intel 4004 Single Board Computer so I wrote this simple Delphi 7 application to do the calculations.

There are two ways to use the application. 
1. You can experimentally manipulate the sliders for the R0-R3 registers until you come up with the delay value that you're looking for. 
2. You and enter the delay (in microseconds) into the lower right corner and click the "Calculate" button.

Once you're satisfied, click the "Copy" button in the upper left corner to copy the delay loop code to the clipboard. Paste the delay loop code into your source file.
